        Marketing is necessary in environments that have a lot of undesired information assymetry. Fixing that is valuable, but how do you monetize it / get compensated?
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          You can get paid to navigate an information environment for those who don't know how to navigate themselves
        </li>
        <li>
          You can fix the environment itself so that information flows freely from those who wish to broadcast, to those who wish to receive it
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Doing (2) creates enormous value for everyone, but it also puts you out of a job as a marketer. This is a case of misaligned incentives. 
      </p>

      <p>
        What we do is work on (2) directly, and figure out ways to fund ourselves that keeps the incentives aligned. Currently this is mostly grants. 
      </p>

      <!-- <p >
        Our main service is consulting on "open source marketing" campaigns. Normally when you reveal your marketing methods you lose (1) the trust of your customers and (2) your competitive advantage as others copy it. A successful open source marketing campaign is one that still works even as everyone knows how it works, AND either cannot easily be copied, or if it is copied, it still helps you. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It's win-win / positive sum marketing.

        The other side is open memetic research - finding blockages in information pathways and monitoring the epistemic health of various networks. For example, an "unhealthy" environment is one where people with resources are looking for competent agents to invest in, and those competent agents exist, but neither side is able to find the other
