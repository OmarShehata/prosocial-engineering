        This is the homepage for <a href="https://omarshehata.me/">Omar Shehata</a>'s independent research work in "applied sociology" / "open-source social engineering". 
      </p>

      <p>
        My work fills the gap between (1) ethical, but passive human population study (academic, government) and (2) active, but hostile culture engineering (propaganda, secret marketing campaigns, hit pieces). This is about active AND transparent social engineering, towards good & wholesome purposes.

          The core of this work is built on original research by <a href="https://x.com/RonenV">Ronen V</a> & his work on a private memetics institution, and funding from <a href="https://x.com/ohhshiny">OhhShiny</a> and <a href="https://kanro.fi/">Vitalik</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
          The open-source methodology is taken from Blaise Aguera's <a href="https://whoarewenow.net/">Who Are We Now</a> book

          Working at Snapchat and using their A/B testing dashboards, while talking to my friends who do sociology at Cornell, was one of the things that gave me the spark to try & bridge these two worlds.

        TODO / WIP
      </h3>
      <p style="color:gray">
        Document the <a href="https://github.com/OmarShehata/prosocial-engineering/issues/1">"portfolio"</a> of work that's been done - includes social norms created, pieces of language successfully engineered & propagated, "memetic origin tracing" theory & practice. And various pieces of theory on how to coordinate social engineering when we're all actively operating on the same shared landscape (it's as if we're all trying to push code to one shared codebase).
      </p>
      <p style="color:gray">
        Also document the <a href="https://github.com/OmarShehata/prosocial-engineering/issues/2">"active work"</a> that is on-going, I was thinking describing it like "minds that we monitor", where "minds" here refers to specific influential individuals, as well as communities. Some of these are "read-only", and some are "read-write".

        Our main service is consulting on "open source marketing" campaigns. Normally when you reveal your marketing methods you lose (1) the trust of your customers and (2) your competitive advantage as others copy it. A successful open source marketing campaign is one that still works even as everyone knows how it works, AND either cannot easily be copied, or if it is copied, it still helps you. 
      </p>

     <p>
        My most notable contribution to the field is popularizing self study. Self monitoring & reporting simultaneously makes it (1) easier for good actors to change your mind

        It's win-win / positive sum marketing.

        The other side is open memetic research - finding blockages in information pathways and monitoring the epistemic health of various networks. For example, an "unhealthy" environment is one where people with resources are looking for competent agents to invest in, and those competent agents exist, but neither side is able to find the other
